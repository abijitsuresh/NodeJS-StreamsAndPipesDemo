They ended up choosing the latter — and it was a good move. Some may feel differently, but the reality is that Angular 1 ended up becoming very complex, especially considering the Angular team didn't have the new JS standards to build on top of.

So what that means is that to learn Angular 2, we also need to learn about the new standards and technologies that it's built on top of. There are primarily four things that we'll need to be familiar with: ES6, TypeScript, RxJS/Observables, and build tools.

We'll be covering RxJS and build tools within this course, but if you're not familiar with ES6 and TypeScript you'll need to fill those in first.
